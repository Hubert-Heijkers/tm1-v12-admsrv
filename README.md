# tm1-v12-admsrv
A v11 compatible, REST API only, TM1 Admin Host!

This adminhost, consumed by REST clients expecting to talk with v11 servers, advertises all TM1 databases on a v12 TM1 service instance!

NOTE: This presumes you have your TM1 v12 instance set up for HTTP passthrough authentication as that's what all v12 oblivious clients expect;-)
